To build avarice: in this directory
./configure
make

To install:
make install

note: on linux machines, if you want to support the Atmel-ICE, you will need libusb and libhidapi headers
how you get them may vary per distribution, an example might be:
sudo apt install libusb-dev
sudo apt install  libhidapi-dev
make sure you do this before you run ./configure

also, if ./configure does not work, you may need to install autoconf, then run
autoconf

before running ./configure
