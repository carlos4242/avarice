To build avarice: in this directory
./configure
make

To install:
make install

note: on linux machines, if you want to support the Atmel-ICE, you will need libusb and libhidapi headers
how you get them may vary per distribution, an example might be:
sudo apt install libusb-dev
sudo apt install  libhidapi-dev

On a raspberry pi running rasbian, all you need is:
sudo apt install libhidapi-dev


make sure you do this before you run ./configure

also, if ./configure does not work, you may need to install autoconf, then run
autoconf

before running ./configure

NOTE: for reasons I don't get, exceptions thrown in the code are not reported with their error messages on the
command line, so for example, if you compile without libhidapi support, the program will build then seemingly
silently fail if you pass switch -4 or --edbg. The true error message "EDBG/CMSIS-DAP devices require libhidapi support"
has somehow been lost and your only clue is an ambiguous exit code 1 instead of 0.


Until this issue is fixed, you'll basically get error code 1 for everything with little clue why.
If you have an atmel-ice plugged in it should attempt to work, as long as libhidapi is installed.


UPDATE: Above issue corrected with a patch on main.cc.
Now jtag exceptions will show their error message and the status code on exit will be a characteristic 10 instead of 1.
